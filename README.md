*Figure 1: Schematics of the approach. Our method comprises a 3D scene completion and a 3D semantic segmentation network.
The former is encapsulated in a VAE framework that employs two sub-networks for conditioning its latent space, a Muti-Scale
Convolutonal Block (MSCB) and a Skimba denoising network. The 3D semantic segmentation network employs a variant of
Skimba. L, W, and H denote the length, width, and height of the original scene, and D is feature map dimension.*

We will release the code soon.
